# Buttons Switches

#### Project Overview

The "Buttons Switches" project focuses on interfacing a push button with an Arduino Mega. This project demonstrates how to read the state of a push button using digital input, specifically utilizing the internal pull-up resistor feature of the Arduino. When the button is pressed, it triggers an action, in this case, printing a message to the serial monitor.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Mega**
2. **Push Button**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the Push Button to Arduino Mega:**
   - Connect one leg of the push button to ground (GND).
   - Connect the other leg of the push button to digital pin 2.

#### Instructions

1. **Code Setup:**
   - Open Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

2. **Upload Code:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.

3. **Testing:**
   - Open the serial monitor in Arduino IDE.
   - Press the push button and observe the serial monitor for the message "Button pressed!".

#### Applications

- **User Input Interface:** Implement user-triggered actions in interactive projects.
- **Control Mechanisms:** Use push buttons for manual control in automation systems.
- **State Detection:** Detect and respond to changes in button state for various applications.

#### Notes

- Ensure proper connection of the push button and verify pin configuration.
- Adjust the delay in the code to debounce the button effectively.
- Expand functionality by adding conditional statements based on button states.
- Consider adding external components like resistors for more complex circuit requirements.
