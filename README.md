# Accelerometer Gyroscope Module

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate an MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope module with an Arduino Mega. The MPU6050 is a 6-axis motion tracking device that provides precise acceleration and gyroscope measurements along the X, Y, and Z axes. Additionally, it can measure ambient temperature, making it suitable for various motion tracking and orientation detection applications.
